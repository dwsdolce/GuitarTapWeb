# Review Findings

Behavioural gaps surfaced during the comment/doc review (see `DEV-DOC-STANDARD.md`).
Category 1 (clear canonical drift — two platforms agree, one differs) is fixed in the
same pass and recorded here as an audit trail. Category 3 (ambiguous, or a real
behavioural decision) is logged for a decision before any change.

## Fixed — category 1 (clear drift; the outlier corrected)

- **[FIXED] dsp/gated-capture — stale gated-window numbers in BOTH Swift and Python arch docs.**
  Constants are `gatedCaptureDuration`=500 ms (accumulation buffer, *includes* the 200 ms pre-roll
  seed), `gatedFFTWindowDuration`=400 ms (post-alignment FFT window), continuous FFT = `fftSize`
  (65536 ≈ 1.36 s). Swift GC-1: header said "continuous FFT ... ≈400 ms at gatedCaptureDuration"
  (wrong constant + wrong window) and the ASCII diagram implied pre-roll + 400 ms were additive.
  GC-3: `startGatedCapture` inline "400 ms capture window" → 500 ms. Python PY-1/PY-2/PY-3 mirror
  all three. Also GC-2: Swift `accumulateGatedSamples` doc named only one of the two dispatch
  branches. Comment-only; corrected diagrams recomputed for alignment. Found the GC-3 Swift instance
  via the Python cross-check (I'd missed it on the Swift-first pass — the reason we read all three).

- **[FIXED] dsp/gated-capture — Python stale "No Swift counterpart yet" (PY-4).** The
  `start_guitar_gated_capture`/`finish_guitar_gated_capture` section comment claimed "no Swift
  counterpart — this is the new design path," but Swift now has both (and the method's own docstring
  already said "mirrors Swift"). Updated to "Mirrors Swift startGuitarGatedCapture / finishGuitarGatedCapture".

- **[DOCUMENTED — intentional divergence, not drift] dsp/gated-capture — guitar/plate dispatch
  branch location differs by design.** Swift branches at the dispatch site (GCD closure can hold
  logic → `finishGatedFFTCapture` vs `finishGuitarGatedCapture`); Python emits one Qt signal
  (`gatedCaptureComplete`) to a single slot and branches inside `finish_gated_fft_capture`. Same
  inputs → same handler → same result; only the branch LOCATION differs, forced by the concurrency
  primitive (GCD closure + @Published vs Qt signal/slot). Added a cross-referencing **PLATFORM
  PLUMBING** comment at both sites (+ a pointer at the Python branch) so the "why do they diverge?"
  question is answered inline. No code change — this is the correct, required platform difference.

- **[FIXED] dsp/gated-fft (opportunistic) — Swift `findDominantPeak` DocC said "15 dB", code uses
  6 dB (GF-1).** Two DocC lines (the Step-2 summary and the `preferLowestSignificant` param) said the
  lowest-frequency candidate is chosen "within 15 dB of the strongest," but the code (`strongest.magnitude
  - 6.0`), its own inline comment, Python's docstring/code, and the web all use **6 dB**. Fixed both to
  6 dB. Surfaced while cross-checking the web's `- 6.0` during gated-capture. Full gated-fft review still
  pending; web `findDominantPeak` tagged `@parity dsp/gated-fft` (M3) so that pass finds it in `gatedCapture.ts`.

- **[FIXED] dsp/peak-analysis — `reanalyzePeaks()` DocC (Swift) had stale "older builds"
  wording.** The function doc still framed re-analyze as "upgrade a measurement saved by an
  older build whose peak-finding algorithm missed some peaks" — the misleading wording we
  corrected everywhere else this session (HelpView, tooltip, button comment, Quick Start,
  manual, Python `reanalyze_peaks`) but missed on this DocC. Updated to "current analysis
  settings (Peak Min, analysis range, guitar type)". Swift comment-only change; Python was
  already correct.

- **[FIXED] dsp/decay — stale "~10 Hz / recentPeakLevelDB polling" cadence in BOTH Swift and
  Python.** Both docs described decay sampling as ~10 Hz via a `recentPeakLevelDB` polling
  subscription, but the actual code feeds `trackDecayFast` **once per audio buffer (~43 Hz)** —
  Swift via a `$inputLevelDB` Combine subscription (`TapToneAnalyzer.swift:1395`), Python via
  `_on_rms_level_changed` (every ~23 ms). The **web comment was already accurate**. Fixed 3 Swift
  spots (DecayTracking DocC architecture + `trackDecayFast` doc + `TapToneAnalyzer.swift:1394`
  inline) and 1 Python docstring. Comment-only; no behaviour change. Stale from an old refactor.

- **[FIXED] dsp/calibration — import frequency filter.** Web `parseCalibration`
  accepted any finite point, but Swift (`MicrophoneCalibration.swift` ~line 333) and
  Python (`microphone_calibration.py` ~line 162) both keep only `1 ≤ freq ≤ 24000` Hz.
  A stray out-of-range line could shift the interpolation edges. Added the same filter
  to `src/dsp/calibration.ts`. Latent (the oracle fixture is in-range); tests green.

## Open — category 3

- **#5 [RESOLVED] calibration — reference-SPL / Sens Factor precedence (Python aligned to Swift).**
  When a header carries BOTH `SESSION REF=…dBSPL` and `SPL … dB`: **Swift** sets SESSION REF then
  unconditionally overwrites with SPL → **SPL / last-occurrence wins** (no `nil` guard). **Python**
  uses `if reference is None:` + `else` → **SESSION REF / first-occurrence wins**. The same
  first-vs-last split applies to `Sens Factor` (Python guards with `if sensitivity is None`, Swift
  overwrites). The new web `parseCalibration` matches **Swift** (canonical). Practically unreachable
  — UMIK-1 files use SESSION REF, REW files use SPL, never both — so no oracle/real-world impact.
  **RESOLVED (user, 2026-07-02): align Python to Swift.** Changed `microphone_calibration.py` to
  overwrite unconditionally (dropped the `if ... is None` guards / `else`), so SPL / last-occurrence
  now wins in Python too. Verified: both present → 88.0 (SPL), SESSION REF only → 94.0, SPL only →
  93.5 — matches Swift/web. Single-format files (the real case) are unchanged; py_compile OK.

## Resolved — category 3

- **[RESOLVED → added] dsp/calibration — `referenceLevel` (SESSION REF / SPL).** Decision
  (user, 2026-07-02): strict parity — **add it to the web**. Added `referenceLevel: number | null`
  to the web `Calibration` type and the `SESSION REF` (UMIK-1) / `SPL` (REW) regexes to
  `parseCalibration` (mirrors Swift/Python; SPL overrides if both present). It round-trips through
  `StoredCalibration` automatically (spread + JSON). Provenance only — no DSP or oracle impact.
  Added a parse test for both header formats. tsc + 144 tests green.

## Map refinements (re-tag + regenerate `parity-index.json` as a batch)

`@parity` mapping gaps (not code bugs) found during the review — the file-level tag
doesn't point at the right canonical file. Fix by adjusting the tag(s) and rerunning
`Tooling/parity/gen_parity_map.py`.

- **M1 — dsp/find-peaks tag is on the model, not the algorithm.** The slug tags Swift
  `ResonantPeak.swift` (the peak *struct*), but the peak-finding *algorithm* lives in
  `TapToneAnalyzer+PeakAnalysis.swift` (Python `tap_tone_analyzer_peak_analysis.py`).
  Web `peaks.ts` holds both. **Decision:** keep `dsp/find-peaks` for the model
  (`ResonantPeak.swift` ↔ `resonant_peak.py` ↔ web `Peak`), and add a separate group
  **`dsp/peak-analysis`** for the algorithm (`TapToneAnalyzer+PeakAnalysis.swift` ↔
  `tap_tone_analyzer_peak_analysis.py` ↔ web `findPeaks` in `peaks.ts`). When the map
  is re-tagged, add `@parity dsp/peak-analysis` to those two files (web `peaks.ts`
  already carries a slug — it hosts both, so it keeps `dsp/find-peaks` and the tracker
  notes the dual role). Then validate the algorithm comments in Swift/Python.

- **M2 — dsp/fft is a web-only primitive; the group has no Swift/Python function counterpart.**
  Web `fft.ts` (`fftInPlace`) is a hand-rolled radix-2 FFT the browser needs because it has no
  built-in FFT. Swift uses Accelerate/vDSP and Python uses `numpy.fft`, so neither has a
  hand-written FFT to mirror — the `@parity dsp/fft` tag on
  `RealtimeFFTAnalyzer+FFTProcessing.swift` / `realtime_fft_analyzer_fft_processing.py` marks the
  library call sites for reference only. The real 3-way algorithmic parity (window → FFT →
  magnitude → dB) is **`dsp/guitar-fft`** (`computeFFT` / `dft_anal` / `guitarFFT.ts`). Map
  improvement: mark `dsp/fft` as an intentional **web-primitive** group (not a 3-way algorithm
  mirror) so the generated map/reader doesn't imply a missing Swift/Python function.

- **M3 — file-level `@parity` tagging is too coarse; move to symbol (function) level.** A single
  file can host functions from several parity groups, and a file-level tag then hides the extra
  members: when a later group's pass consults the map, it lands on that group's Swift/Python files
  and never learns the web counterpart is buried in an unrelated file, so it is **silently skipped**
  (only the deferred/untagged tail backstop would ever eyeball it — not a real 3-way cross-check).
  **Exemplar: `src/dsp/guitarFFT.ts`** hosts three groups — `dftAnalRect` = `dsp/guitar-fft`,
  `averagePowerDb` = `dsp/spectrum-average`, and the orchestration trio (`guitarModePeaks`,
  `modePeaksFromSpectrum`, `guitarMultiTapModePeaks`) = `audio/tap-analyzer` (the web has no
  analyzer class, so the per-tap/multi-tap flow lives here as free functions). **Done now:** added
  a per-symbol `// @parity <slug>` tag above each of those functions (the file-level
  `@parity dsp/guitar-fft` on line 1 is kept as the primary so nothing drops out before the
  generator is upgraded); only `dftAnalRect` (this group) was doc-enriched — the others are
  tagged/routed and will be doc-enriched under their own group with the canonical open. **Batch
  TODO (with M1/M2 regen):** (a) confirm/upgrade `Tooling/parity/gen_parity_map.py` to record each
  tag's *symbol* (line/name), not just the file, so the map/reader can point a reviewer at the exact
  function; (b) migrate the line-1 file tag to an adjacent `dftAnalRect` tag once the generator is
  symbol-aware; (c) sweep the other multi-function DSP files for the same coarse-tag problem.
